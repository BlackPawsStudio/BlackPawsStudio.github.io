#### How to use

First you choose the size of the field you want to create. Keep in mind that this is an old project and huge fields will took long to render.

When the field renders you have to set the start and end points of the field. Then you can set obstacles and choose if you want algorithm to count walking diagonally. When everything is set up, press `Count path` and the algorithm will render the path with blue color and all options it was looking through with wheat color. Press `Reset path` if you want to modify obstacles or `Reset all` to fully recreate the field.
